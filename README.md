The world has evolved over the years and this evolution has impacted the world
of technology as well, which gave birth to the IoT.
The main mission of our project is the analysis of IoT data through machine
learning. An analysis that followed important steps, with the use of several
machine learning models to ultimately result in a prediction.
Statistics and machine learning can help us predict various relationships and
variables based on the data.
In this project we are trying to predict the temperature based on meteorological
variables.
